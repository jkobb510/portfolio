## About Me

I am currently a software engineer that works for Bakkt as an SDET, focusing on manual UI, API, and Selenium automation testing on web/mobile environments.

I graduated with Computer Science degree at Georgia State University, where I developed my foundation in objected-oriented programming in Java. I have since been driven by my passion in software development towards life-long learning.
