# Hi, I'm Seung

I am currently working as an SDET (Software Development Engineer in Test) at Bakkt, focusing manual and automation testing of React-based web and mobile features using TypeScript and WebdriverIO.

I graduated with Computer Science degree at Georgia State University, where I developed my foundation in objected-oriented programming in Java. I have since been driven by my passion in software development towards life-long learning.
