## About Me

I am a software engineer with experience in web development and software testing. I worked for Bakkt as an SDET, focusing on manual UI and API testing and designing Selenium test automation scripts. In addition, I have also worked on iOS development as a freelancer and have had numerous other projects to sharpen my skills as a developer.
