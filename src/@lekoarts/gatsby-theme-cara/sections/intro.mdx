## About Me

I am a software engineer with experience in web development and software testing. I worked for Bakkt as an SDET, focusing on manual UI, API, and Selenium automation testing. In addition, I have also worked on iOS development as a freelancer and have had numerous other projects to sharpen my skills as a developer. 

I graduated with a B.S. in Computer Science at Georgia State University, where I developed my foundation in objected-oriented programming in Java. I have since been driven by my passion in software development towards life-long learning.
